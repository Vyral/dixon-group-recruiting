<u><a target="_blank" href="https://joindgod.com/scale-series-part-2-culture.html">Last time</a></u>, we touched on accountability, explaining how **we meet with all of our agents weekly** to ensure they’re acting with purpose and efficiency.

Before he joined the Dixon Group, top producer Dan Brener worked as a solo agent. He didn’t have much structure in his life—he just rolled with the punches. Since joining us, however, he’s learned that when you attack each day and week with intention and hold yourself accountable, then you’ll start accomplishing the goals you’ve set for yourself, your clients, and your business

In this business, we usually don’t take days off because the work we put in today will pay off in a month or so. That means we need to hold ourselves accountable for each day’s activities, so we can grow our business throughout the year. If we can manage to hold ourselves accountable in all the right ways, **that growth will also spill over into our personal lives**.

If you have any questions about how to add accountability to your business and your life, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be happy to schedule a quick, 15-minute call to help you develop your success.

When you’re creating a culture in your business, **do you want it to come by design or by default?** We’ve been very intentional about maintaining our culture and who we bring into our world. So if you’re building your business team right now or you’re just looking to add a transaction coordinator or lender, be sure that they mesh well with your business’ culture.

**All of our agents are held to a very high standard of accountability**, which is one of the most important staples of our culture. We’ve found that the top producing agents like this too; every week, they track their metrics and submit them to the team’s Slack channel on Sunday.

Not only do we have leadership accountability, but **we also have team accountability**. Each agent knows they’re reporting those metrics on Sunday evening for the whole team to see what they’ve accomplished.

Then, each Monday, we’ll do a quick one-on-one with each agent where we’ll review their pipelines, their Boomtown profiles, etc., and generally analyze what they’ve been doing over the past 30 days and how that has contributed to the current state of their business. **We want them to have both intention and awareness behind their daily and weekly activities** so that as we’re going over their quarterly and yearly progress, we have a clear understanding of their overall position.

**The second aspect of culture to focus on is family environment**. When you join the Dixon Group, we always joke that you become part of the family, but it’s true—when you create a partnership with someone, you need to have an emotional connection with them so that they know they’re supported and a part of the team. We’re a team of like-minded individuals with open minds, and all our agents embody the family mentality.

The last facet of culture is understanding your ‘why.’ **Your whole team needs to understand your underlying motivation for what it is you do and how they contribute to it**. When everyone’s on board, everyone has the same base motivations to do the best they can every single day.

The Dixon Group strives for culture by design. To maintain your culture, you have to be reminded of it every single day. If you don’t, yours will become a culture by default instead of by design.

Next time, we’ll discuss the A in SCALE: accountability. If you’d like more information about building a team or anything else to do with fostering a better real estate career, I highly recommend that you read “Great Teams: 16 Things High-Performing Organizations Do Differently” by Don Yager.

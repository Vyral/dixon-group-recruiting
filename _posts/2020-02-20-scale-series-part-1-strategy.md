A business is only as successful as the strategies behind it. Today in this first part of our new series, I’ll share a few of our business strategies as tips to help you increase your success.

Before each new year, we hold a **1-3-5 goal-setting session** with each of our agents—if you’d like a template of these sessions, reach out to me and I’d be glad to send it to you so you can set up your own. In short, each agent sets one major goal with three objectives and five “hows” to achieve that goal. This is an incredible tool that allows each agent to have a vision for success in the coming year.

To parallel their 1-3-5s, **we also do what we call a 411, where they each present their objectives for the month broken down into weeks.** This allows them to track how many appointments they need to have with lenders and sellers.

Speaking of tracking, we also make a point to track everything week after week so that our agents have a good grasp of where their business currently sits. That way, if they’re not on track, we can catch that before we get too far into the year. Tracking is a massive portion of our business plan; **implementing a tracking system in your business will give you clarity and help you do what you need to do each day faster.**

Our group’s theme is intentional living. One of the key pieces of living that theme is maintaining a work/life balance. We like to check in with each of our agents to find out how they’re doing in terms of their housing, family, interests, etc. They work hard every day, so we **strategize to help them find a balance between their work and home life** so they can continue to operate their business and enjoy life while they do it.

Next time in part two of our Scale series we’ll talk about culture. If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Dixon Group. We are here to be a resource for you.
